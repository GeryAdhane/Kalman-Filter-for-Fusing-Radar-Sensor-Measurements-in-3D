# Kalman-Filter-for-Fusing-Radar-Sensor-Measurements-in-3D
State estimation for target tracking (Single Sensor, Single Target) with nonlinear kalman filter
This is an extended kalman filter implementation in matlab for fusing radar sensor measurement in 3D. The sensor measures the three-dimensional target including the range (distance) <i>r</i>, azimuth angle (turning angle) \Theta,
and elevation angle (elevation angle) \Phi . 
 
Range <i>r</i> denotes the measured distance of the target from the center of the tracker, while the azimuth angle or swivel angle \Theta, shows the direction of motion of the tracker rotation in the direction of the x-axis and y-axis, and the elevation angle \Phi indicates the direction of motion of trackers' elevation in the direction of <i>x, y,</i> to<i> z </i>axis.
